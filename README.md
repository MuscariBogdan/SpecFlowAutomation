## Introduction

This project is a demonstration of how to use SpecFlow with Selenium WebDriver to create automated test scenarios. It uses the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to improve the maintainability and readability of the test code.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following tools and dependencies:

- Visual Studio with SpecFlow plugin
- .NET Framework
- Chrome WebDriver (included in the project)
- SpecFlow and NUnit packages (already included in the project)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to restore packages.
4. Open Test Explorer and run the SpecFlow scenarios.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured organization with separate folders for page objects, step definitions, and feature files.

- **LoginAutomation**
  - **Feature**: Contains the Gherkin feature files with test scenarios.
  - **PageObjects**: Contains classes that represent the web pages using the Page Object Model.
  - **StepDefinitions**: Contains classes with step definitions for the SpecFlow scenarios.

## Usage

To run the automated tests, simply build the solution and execute the SpecFlow scenarios using Test Explorer in Visual Studio. The tests will run using Chrome WebDriver by default.
